## Summary

This project aims to be a base astro site example to demonstrate a starting off point for using astro and react. Examples of different methods of state management are included.


## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ react
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (Data structure types)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ AppIsland.tsx
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ (Helper code thats more general)
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
